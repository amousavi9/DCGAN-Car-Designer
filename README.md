### [DCGAN-Car-Designer](https://github.com/amousavi9/DCGAN-Car-Designer) propose a GANs-based method to Car design generation

GANs are a special kind of deep network capable of modeling distributions of data. More explicitly, GANs can learn to "sample" or "create" new data that looks like an existing dataset. This repository use a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Nets (DCGANs) to design and generate new Cars images. DCGAN is one of the popular and successful network design for GAN.

The training images used in this project were obtained from Carvana and Carmax.

# Results
Below are some creative fake Car images generated by [DCGAN.ipynb](https://github.com/amousavi9/DCGAN-Car-Designer/blob/main/DCGAN.ipynb).
